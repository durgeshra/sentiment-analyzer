A Naive-Bayes classifier is trained over movie reviews from IMDb taken from the link: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/
When trained over 12500 positive and negative examples each and tested over 25000 examples, it gives accuracy of about 76% with F-score of about 0.75.
I have used the Snowball stemmer from NLTK.
